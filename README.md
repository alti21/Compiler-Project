# Compiler-Project
CMPE 152 Compiler Project for Custom Programming Language
For this project, our group has developed a programming language that is similar to C++. We called it Pi++. 
It is much smaller than C++ in the sense that we took several parts of C++ and used only those parts for our language. 
In essence our language is somewhat similar to small C, 
but we do have less constructs in our language and we used different names for some of our constructs.
